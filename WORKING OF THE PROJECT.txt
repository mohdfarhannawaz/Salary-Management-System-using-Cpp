WORKING OF THE PROJECT 

****************************************************************

Certainly! Here's a line-by-line explanation of the code for beginners:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
```
- This section includes the necessary libraries for input/output, string manipulation, working with vectors (dynamic arrays), and generating random numbers.

```cpp
struct Employee {
    std::string name;
    int id;
    int workingDays;
    int leaves;
    double netSalary;
};
```
- This defines a structure called `Employee` that represents an employee's data. It includes fields for their name, ID, number of working days, number of leaves, and net salary.

```cpp
void generateRandomData(std::vector<Employee>& employees) {
    // ...
}
```
- This function generates random employee data and populates it into a vector passed as a parameter.

```cpp
void displaySalaryReport(const std::vector<Employee>& employees) {
    // ...
}
```
- This function displays the salary report by taking a vector of `Employee` as a parameter and printing the data in a formatted table.

```cpp
void editSalaryReport(std::vector<Employee>& employees) {
    // ...
}
```
- This function allows the user to edit the salary report by taking a vector of `Employee` as a parameter, prompting the user for an employee ID, and allowing them to modify the working days and leaves of the specified employee.

```cpp
int main() {
    std::string username, password;
    int loginAttempts = 0;
    bool loggedIn = false;
    // ...
}
```
- The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
- It declares variables for the username, password, login attempts, and a boolean flag to track whether the user is logged in.

```cpp
while (!loggedIn && loginAttempts < 5) {
    // ...
}
```
- This starts a loop that continues until the user successfully logs in or exceeds the maximum login attempts.
- It prompts the user for their username and password and checks if they match the expected values.

```cpp
if (loggedIn) {
    int choice = 0;
    std::vector<Employee> employees;
    generateRandomData(employees);
    // ...
}
```
- If the user successfully logs in, this code block is executed.
- It declares a variable for the user's choice, creates an empty vector to store employee data, and generates random data using the `generateRandomData` function.

```cpp
while (choice != 3) {
    // ...
}
```
- This starts a loop that continues until the user chooses to exit the program.
- It prompts the user for their choice and executes different code blocks based on the chosen option.

```cpp
if (choice == 1) {
    int reportChoice = 0;
    // ...
}
```
- If the user chooses option 1 (Employee Salary Report), this code block is executed.
- It declares a variable for the sub-choice within the Employee Salary Report option.

```cpp
while (reportChoice != 3) {
    // ...
}
```
- This starts a loop that continues until the user chooses to go back to the main menu within the Employee Salary Report option.

```cpp
else if (choice == 2) {
    std::string newPassword, confirmNewPassword;
    // ...
}
```
- If the user chooses option 2 (Change Password), this code block is executed.
- It declares variables for the new password and confirms the new password.

```cpp
else if (choice == 3) {
    std::cout << "Exiting the program..." << std::endl;
}
```
- If the user chooses option 3 (Exit)
```cpp
else if (choice == 3) {
    std::cout << "Exiting the program..." << std::endl;
}
```
- If the user chooses option 3 (Exit), this code block is executed.
- It displays a message indicating that the program is exiting.

```cpp
else {
    std::cout << "Invalid choice. Please try again." << std::endl;
}
```
- If the user enters an invalid choice, this code block is executed.
- It displays a message indicating that the choice is invalid and prompts the user to try again.

```cpp
return 0;
}
```
- This line marks the end of the `main()` function.
- It returns the value 0 to indicate successful program execution.

This is a high-level explanation of the code. The program flow involves prompting the user to login, offering different options based on their login status, and providing functionality for displaying the employee salary report, editing the report, changing the password, and exiting the program. The program uses loops, conditional statements, and functions to implement these features.
